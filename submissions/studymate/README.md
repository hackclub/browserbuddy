## Features
Currently, the app is in development. Right now, there's a cute little pixel art pomodoro timer with the features to switch from timer and track the amount of finished timers.

_Coming soon üëÄ_: User settings, an option to block websites, a logo (of course!) a parrot which randomly blurts out motivational quotes(?) -- enough reason to stay tuned!
**Note:** My friend Froxcey will do the art, and since he got a lot of papers to finish, the art-related things won't be in it before Christmas. _What nice of a Christmas present! üéÑ‚ú®_
