# Blade
Blade works as a basic ad-blocker, but it also removes pop-ups that may appear when a website detects you are using an ad-blocker.

## Installation Instructions
Run: ```git clone https://github.com/grandell1234/Blade.git```

Then go to ```chrome://extensions``` (if you are using a chromium based browser replace "chrome" with whatever browser you are using such as: arc://extensions)

Turn on Developer Mode by toggeling the switch in the upper right corner:

Press "Load Unpacked" and select the file "Blade" that you just installed:

You can now use the extension, there is no config it just runs 24/7 in the background, if you make any edits to the script locally just press the refresh button!:
