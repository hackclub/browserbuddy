Truth-Finder Extension
Truth-Finder is a Chrome extension that empowers you to quickly verify the accuracy of online information. In an age where misinformation spreads rapidly, Truth-Finder automatically scans web pages to highlight and fact-check questionable claims using the Google Fact-Check Tools API.

Note

While Truth-Finder leverages fact-check reviews from reputable sources, the reliability of the displayed results depends on the data available in the API. There might be occasional discrepancies, so use the tool as a helpful guide rather than an absolute verdict.

ü§î What's This All About?

Have you ever doubted the truth behind a news article or social media post? Truth-Finder makes it easy to distinguish between verified information and potential misinformation. The extension scans text on any webpage and, if it finds any signs of dubious claims, instantly displays an in-page notification with a detailed fact-check result. With clear, color-coded indicators, you get immediate visual feedback to help you decide which content to trust.
