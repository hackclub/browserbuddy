# Truth-Finder

Truth-Finder is a Chrome extension that automatically scans web pages to detect and highlight potentially misleading information using the Google Fact-Check Tools API. It displays dynamic, in-page notifications—color-coded red for fake, green for factual, and gray when no fact-check reviews are found—so users can easily verify the authenticity of the content they encounter online.

## Features

- **Automatic Scanning:** Automatically detects and highlights questionable content on any webpage.
- **In-Page Notifications:** Displays dynamic notifications directly above the selected text.
- **Color-Coded Alerts:** 
  - **Red:** Indicates potentially fake or misleading information.
  - **Green:** Indicates that the information appears to be factual.
  - **Gray:** Indicates no fact-check reviews were found.
- **User-Controlled Dismissal:** Notifications remain until manually closed.
